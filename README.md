Bob Build Tool
==============

Bob is a build automation tool inspired by bitbake and portage. It is intended
for complex embedded projects and thus focuses on reproducible builds while
still being nice to developers in agile environments.

Getting started
===============

It's probably the best to head over to the
[documentation](http://bob-build-tool.readthedocs.io/). To get an impression
of how Bob is configured, have a look at the
[tutorials](https://github.com/BobBuildTool/bob-tutorials). A real project that
is built by Bob can be found [here](https://github.com/BobBuildTool/basement).
