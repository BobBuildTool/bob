Verify handling of wrong build-id predictions

Live-build-ids are inherently racy. Between the moment the server is queried
and the checkout of the sources some changes could be applied. This will
invalidate the initial build-id prediction and Bob has to re-evaluate all build
results as they may rely on outdated sources.

Dependency tree:

       root
        |
    /---+---\
  left     right
    \---+---/
        |
      common   <-- checks out the "sources"

The change is faked in this test by applying a commit in the checkout step of
the "common" package.  The result of the "right" package is downloaded while
the result of the "left" package cannot be found. This forces a build of the
"common" and "left" package. The test validates that the correct result is in
the final workspace.
