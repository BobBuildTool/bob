Bob 1.1 Release Notes
=====================

Changes made since Bob 1.0 include the following.

New features
------------

* Bob gained the ability to express dependencies between tools.

  A tool declared by :ref:`configuration-recipes-provideTools` can specify
  additional tool dependencies via ``dependTools`` and/or ``dependToolsWeak``.
  If a recipe uses the declared tool, all specified dependencies will be added
  implicitly to the used tool list.

  See :pull:`639`.
* The :ref:`configuration-recipes-shared` attribute was upgraded to a full
  boolean property.

  Previously, the ``shared`` attribute could just be set statically to
  ``True``.  Now it is possible to use a boolean expression to control the
  sharing based on the recipe input.

  See :pull:`640`.

Improvements
------------

* Bob has been made more resilient with respect to binary artifact corruptions.

  Any downloaded artifact is checked for its integrity. Specifically, the
  checksum of the extracted files is compared to the audit trail. This should
  detect any accidental corruptions. See :issue:`636` and :pull:`637`.
* Bob now prints the full file name of files where the YAML parsing has failed.
  (:issue:`641`, :pull:`642`).
* The ``$(resubst)`` regular expression :ref:`string substitution function
  <configuration-principle-subst>` has been added. (:pull:`643`)

Bug fixes
---------

* DNS resolution failures are not treated as error any more when downloading
  artifacts. (:pull:`638`)
* A crash in :meth:`bob.input.Package.isAlias` has been fixed.
