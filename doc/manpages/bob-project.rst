Eclipse CDT project generator
-----------------------------

::

    bob project eclipseCdt <package> [-h] [-u] [--buildCfg BUILDCFG] [--overwrite]
                            [--destination DEST] [--name NAME]
                            [--exclude EXCLUDES] [-I ADDITIONAL_INCLUDES]

The Eclipse CDT generator has the following specific options. They have to be
passed on the command line *after* the package name.

``--buildCfg BUILDCFG``
    Adds a new buildconfiguration. Format: <Name>::<flags>. Flags are passed
    to bob dev. See bob dev for a list of availabe flags.

``--destination DEST``
    Destination of project files.

``--exclude EXCLUDES``
    Packages will be marked as 'exclude from build' in eclipse. Usefull if indexer runs OOM.

``-I ADDITIONAL_INCLUDES``
    Additional include directories.

``--name NAME``
    Name of project. Default is complete_path_to_package

``--overwrite``
    Remove destination folder before generating.

``-u, --update``
    Update project files (.project).


QtCreator project generator
---------------------------

::

    bob project qt-project <package> [-h] [-u] [--buildCfg BUILDCFG] [--overwrite]
                           [--destination DEST] [--name NAME]
                           [-I ADDITIONAL_INCLUDES] [-f Filter]
                           [--exclude Excludes] [--include Includes] [--kit KIT]
                           [-S START_INCLUDES] [-C CONFIG_DEF]

This generator also supports generation of project files for native Windows QtCreator 
by using MSYS2. The prerequisite is, that MSYS2 must be started by msys2_shell.cmd script.

The QtCreator project generator has the following specific options. They have
to be passed on the command line *after* the package name.

``--buildCfg BUILDCFG``
    Adds a new buildconfiguration. Format: <Name>::<flags>

``--destination DEST``
    Destination of project files

``-f Filter, --filter Filter``
    File filter. A regex for matching additional files.

``--exclude Excludes``
    Package filter. A regex for excluding packages in QTCreator.

``--include Includes``
    Include package filter. A regex for including only the specified packages in QTCreator.
    Use single quotes to specify your regex. For exmaple: --include 'foobar-.*'
    You can also mix the Includes with the Excludes. In this case always use the Includes option beforehand.
    For example: --include 'foobar-.*' --exclude 'foobar-baz' This will ensure you only include packages
    wtih foobar-* but excludes the foobar-baz package.

``-I ADDITIONAL_INCLUDES``
    Additional include directories.

``--kit KIT``
    Name of the kit to use for this project.

    Qt Creator usually auto-detects your installed compilers on the system and
    creates one or more "kits" based on the detected settings. Bob will use the
    "Desktop" kit by default. The generator cannot create a project if
    QtCreator is not installed. If the "Desktop" kit is missing you have to
    create one or specify an existing one with the ``--kit`` option.

    See the online documentation [#l1]_ for more information.

``--name NAME``
    Name of project. Default is complete_path_to_package

``--overwrite``
    Remove destination folder before generating.

``-u, --update``
    Update project files (.files, .includes, .config)

``-S START_INCLUDES``
    Additional include directories, will be placed at the beginning of the include list.

``-C CONFIG_DEF``
    Add line to .config file. Can be used to specify preprocessor defines used by the QTCreator.

Visual Studio Code project generator

    bob project vscode <package> [-h] [--name NAME] [--destination DEST]
                       [--exclude EXCLUDES]
                       [--include INCLUDE] [-I ADDITIONAL_INCLUDES]
                       [-S START_INCLUDES] [--sort]

The Visual Studio Code generator will generate a single .code-workspace file which could be opened in the Visual Studio Code. 

The Visual Studio Code generator has the following specific options. They have to be
passed on the command line *after* the package name.

``--name NAME``
    Name of project. Default is package_name

``--destination DEST``
    Destination of project files.

``--exclude EXCLUDES``
    Package filter. A regex for excluding packages in VSCode.

``--include INCLUDE``
    Include package filter. A regex for including only the specified packages in VSCode.
    Use single quotes to specify your regex. For exmaple: --include 'foobar-.*'
    You can also mix the Includes with the Excludes. In this case always use the Includes option beforehand.
    For example: --include 'foobar-.*' --exclude 'foobar-baz' This will ensure you only include packages
    wtih foobar-* but excludes the foobar-baz package.

``-I ADDITIONAL_INCLUDES``
    Additional include directories.
